# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1:
### July 15, 2019

I spent the day working on a python script that is inspired by Github's hexbot.
Intended for pixel art drawings, it changes each color found in the image to a
random color.
I also started working on a change for my blogging site to list all of the posts
differently on the site.

## Day 2
### July 16, 2019
I spent today trying to work with githooks. I want to try and have an email be
sent out whenever I update my 100 days of code repo to a few people to help me
stay accountable to the challenge. Didn't figure it out just yet.

## Day 3
### July 17, 2019
Finally figured out what I was doing wrong with my githook yesterday. Turned out I was using the wrong one.. Originally I was planning on using some 3rd party API to send emails, but I think I am going to configure my linux box to do it instead.
