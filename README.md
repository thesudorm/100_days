# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1:
### July 15, 2019

I spent the day working on a python script that is inspired by Github's hexbot.
Intended for pixel art drawings, it changes each color found in the image to a
random color.
I also started working on a change for my blogging site to list all of the posts
differently on the site.
