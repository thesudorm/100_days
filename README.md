# 100 Days of Code

## Day 1:
### July 15, 2019

I spent the day working on a python script that is inspired by Github's hexbot.
Intended for pixel art drawings, it changes each color found in the image to a
random color.
I also started working on a change for my blogging site to list all of the posts
differently on the site.

## Day 2
### July 16, 2019
I spent today trying to work with githooks. I want to try and have an email be
sent out whenever I update my 100 days of code repo to a few people to help me
stay accountable to the challenge. Didn't figure it out just yet.

## Day 3
### July 17, 2019
Finally figured out what I was doing wrong with my githook yesterday. Turned out I was using the wrong one.. Originally I was planning on using some 3rd party API to send emails, but I think I am going to configure my linux box to do it instead.


## Day 4
### July 17, 2019

I figured out a really simple git hook that sends an email right before a git push is completed on my 100 days of code repo. These githooks seem super powerful.

## Day 5
### July 18, 2019

I am starting to finish my script for sending emails on git pushes. I figured out how to get the text from a git diff between a current and previous commit. The idea is that I can send the git in the body of an email. Should finish it tomorrow.

## Day 6
### July 19, 2019

Still working on my bash hook to send an automated email. I am so close to being done. I just need to figure out why the file I am creating is not getting the correct text put into it.
